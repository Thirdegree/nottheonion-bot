Thank you for your submission to /r/NotTheOnion!  Unfortunately, your submission was automatically removed since your submission's title appears to be different from the headline of the article you submitted.  Submissions with altered titles are not permitted, all titles must be the headline from the article, copy-and-pasted. 

#Please read the information below *before* modmailing. 

* Do not add **periods or quotation marks** to the title, or change the style of quotation marks used (for example, changing single quotes to double quotes). This will cause your submission to be automatically removed, as the title has been altered.

* Do not use the **suggest title button**.  Instead, copy-and-paste the article's title *directly* from the link you are submitting.  The suggest title button's output is often different from the article's actual title.

* Make sure your source doesn't have a **paywall**.  Because of the method I use to check titles, I've tripped just about every paywall in existence, which may cause an occasional incorrect removal.  If your source does have a paywall, please find an alternative source that is not behind a paywall.

You may resubmit with the correct title, but remember that our other rules must be followed as well.  For more information on our rules, check out /r/NotTheOnion/w/NTO101.
